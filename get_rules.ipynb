            "Lexical-Functional Grammar (LFG) is a linguistic theory that aims to provide a precise and comprehensive account of the syntactic and semantic structure of natural language. It was developed by Joan Bresnan and her colleagues in the 1980s. LFG is a constraint-based framework that separates the syntactic structure (c-structure) from the functional structure (f-structure), allowing for a more modular and transparent representation of linguistic phenomena.\n",
            "\n",
            "Below is a list of key rules and principles of LFG, presented in an ordered list:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **C-Structure (Constituent Structure)**\n",
            "   - **Rule 1:** Every sentence is represented as a hierarchical tree structure, known as the c-structure.\n",
            "   - **Rule 2:** The c-structure is generated by a set of context-free grammar rules.\n",
            "   - **Rule 3:** Each node in the c-structure represents a constituent of the sentence.\n",
            "   - **Rule 4:** The c-structure provides the linear order and immediate dominance relations of the constituents.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **F-Structure (Functional Structure)**\n",
            "   - **Rule 5:** Each c-structure is associated with one or more f-structures, which capture the functional aspects of the sentence.\n",
            "   - **Rule 6:** F-structures are represented as attribute-value matrices (AVMs).\n",
            "   - **Rule 7:** F-structures include grammatical functions such as subject (SUBJ), object (OBJ), and complement (COMPL).\n",
            "   - **Rule 8:** F-structures can be disjunctive, allowing for multiple interpretations of a single c-structure.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Correspondence Conditions**\n",
            "   - **Rule 9:** There must be a one-to-one correspondence between the constituents in the c-structure and the elements in the f-structure.\n",
            "   - **Rule 10:** The correspondence is governed by a set of well-formedness conditions that ensure consistency between c-structure and f-structure.\n",
            "   - **Rule 11:** The mapping from c-structure to f-structure is determined by a set of functional uncertainty rules.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Lexical Rules**\n",
            "   - **Rule 12:** Lexical items are the primary source of grammatical information.\n",
            "   - **Rule 13:** Each lexical item has an associated lexical entry in the lexicon, specifying its syntactic, semantic, and phonological properties.\n",
            "   - **Rule 14:** Lexical rules can modify the f-structure of lexical items to accommodate syntactic and semantic variations.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Functional Uncertainty**\n",
            "   - **Rule 15:** F-structures can be underspecified, allowing for multiple interpretations.\n",
            "   - **Rule 16:** The degree of underspecification is determined by the context and the constraints of the language.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. **Lexical Rules and Constraints**\n",
            "   - **Rule 17:** Lexical rules can introduce new elements into the f-structure, such as auxiliaries or complements.\n",
            "   - **Rule 18:** Constraints on lexical rules ensure that the resulting f-structures are well-formed and consistent with the grammar.\n",
            "\n",
            "7. **Semantic Interpretation**\n",
            "   - **Rule 19:** The semantic interpretation of a sentence is derived from its f-structure.\n",
            "   - **Rule 20:** The f-structure provides the necessary information for semantic composition and interpretation.\n",
            "\n",
            "8. **Phonological Interpretation**\n",
            "   - **Rule 21:** The phonological form of a sentence is derived from its c-structure.\n",
            "   - **Rule 22:** Phonological rules apply to the c-structure to generate the surface form of the sentence.\n",
            "\n",
            "These rules form the foundation of Lexical-Functional Grammar, providing a structured and modular approach to the analysis of natural language.\n"
